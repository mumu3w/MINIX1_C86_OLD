The sources to the library are contained in an archive to save disk space.
Since MINIX uses a minimum of 1K for each file, no matter how small,
the sources take up less space when packed together in an archive.  To
extract them, make sure there is at least 120K of free disk space, and type:
	ar xv libsrc.a
